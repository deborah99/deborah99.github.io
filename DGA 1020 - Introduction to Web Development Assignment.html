    <h1>The Use Of Digital Art Software In Digital Art Performances And Installations</h1>
    <p>Digital art software has become a go-to artistic medium for many young artists. Virtual reality, digital installations, projection mapping and video jockeying are only a few of the creations these artists have created with the help of digital art software.</p>

    <h2>Digital Art Performances</h2>
    <p>The performing arts have been a popular form of art for years now. Despite having the original term 'performance art' created between the late 1950s and early 60s, theatre,music and dance, amongst others, performed by an audience, had been around more than these mentioned dates.</p>
    
    <p>As technology advanced and visual artists became more curious and inspired, the digital medium managed to integrate with the traditional performing arts. Such performances may require user/viewer interaction aka HCI (Human-Computer Interaction).</p>

    <p>The works of Sara Heitlinger show the importance of HCI. Below, she uses a traditional sewn up quilt, integrated with digital technology. Each hexagonal fabric patch has radio frequency identification buttons that trigger playback of recorded history interviews.</p>
    
    <p>It was made with the purpose of making an everyday object brought to life and to combine its 3 aspects together:
        <ul>
            <li>the physical aspect</li>
            <li>the social aspect</li>
            <li>the technological aspect</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Another example of spectacular Digital Art Performances are the works of Adrien Mondot and Claire Bardainne.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Through gestures and image, the real and virtual worlds collide, no longer separated. The performances are also synchronised with a soundscape made up of a mix of electronic music, recorded acoustic instruments and realist noise environments. Their interactive ways are set to overcome the technical challenge by using motion capturing systems from video game technology.</p>

    <h2>Digital Art Installations</h2>
    <p>Having digital installations shows how freer artists have become to create diverse types of art. This means that it has to udnerstand the audience's emotions in a way to evoke unique feelings through expressive and impressive virtual experiences.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>'Behaviours of Light' by JNZBRK</h3></li>
        
            <p>This piece is made up carefully of selected materials and two projection sources. Everything is composed in a way to for light to register on walls, ceiling and floor of the designated locations.</p>

            <br><br>

            <li><h3>'Plane White' by Carina Ow</h3></li>

            <p>The installation showed how art exhibitions can go beyond their traditional stand points. It features Kandinsky's 'Composition VIII' painting. This artwork is interactive in a way where the viewer can go through the motions to recreate Kandinsky's painting.</p>

        </ul>
    
        <h2>Projection Mapping</h2>
        <p>Projection mapping is a video projection technology in which video is mapped onto a surface, turning common objects - such as buildings, runways, stages and even water - into interactive displays.</p>
        <p>In order to achieve this you need to follow these steps:
            <ol>
                <li>Choosing the right canvas</li>
                <li>Calculating your lighting levels</li>
                <li>Developing the content</li>
                <li>Setting up</li>
                <li>Final tweaks and testing</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Digital Art Software can be crucial for expressive art. As new software and technological features emerge, the greater is the range of what artists can do and which path they should take.</p>
